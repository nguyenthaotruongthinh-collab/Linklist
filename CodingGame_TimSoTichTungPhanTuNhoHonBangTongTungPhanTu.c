/*
Goal
You will be given a starting number start and a closing number end. You must find the number of numbers in between start and end (both inclusive) that apply to the following condition:
â‡¨ The sum of its digits should be greater than or equal to the product of its digits.

For Example: If start = 50 and end = 60, there are three numbers that apply to the condition.
They are 50 ( product = 0, sum = 5 ), 51 ( product = 5, sum = 6 ) and 60 ( product = 0, sum = 6 )

Input
Line1: [start] and [end]

Output
Line 1: No. of magic numbers

Constraints
10 < start < end < 5000
Example
Input
20 30

Output
4
